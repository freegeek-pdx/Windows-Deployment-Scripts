# Requires Latest Windows ISOs: https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10 & https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
# When the Windows 10 download page is viewed on Mac or Linux, you have the option to download the ISO directly, but when viewed on Windows you can only download the Media Creation Tool (instead of direct ISO download) which can then be used to export an ISO.
# Instead of using the Media Creation Tool on Windows, a workaround to be able to download the ISO directly on Windows is to use the Developer Tools options in Chrome or Firefox to change the User Agent or use Responsive Design Mode and then reload the page.
# Or, use the Fido script (https://github.com/pbatard/Fido) built into Rufus: https://rufus.ie/en/

# Reference (Modify a WIM): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/mount-and-modify-a-windows-image-using-dism
# Reference (Reduce Size of WIM): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/reduce-the-size-of-the-component-store-in-an-offline-windows-image

# IMPORTANT: "\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Deployment Tools\DandISetEnv.bat" is run from within the CMD launcher file first for latest "DISM" from the ADK to be used.

# NOTE: There is at least one monthly Cumulative Update that would be time consuming during the setup process, so this script should be run monthly or so to create an updated WIM for the installation process to use instead of needing to rely on Windows Update as much during setup.
# This script will always install updates on top of the original source image directly from the ISO.
# Updates ARE NOT added on top of to the last updated WIM because it is not necessary and may just unnecessarily bloat the WIM (but DISM's /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase and then exporting a new compressed image should take care of any bloat anyway).
# Previous WIMs (with the updated date in the filename) will be left in the $wimOutputPath folder when newly updated WIMs are created to be deleted at your discretion. I generally keep one previous WIM for quick rollback if necessary and manually delete anything older than that.

				# So, I switched all WIM mounting to be within the system temporary directory and now all Cumulative Updates appear to be installing for all WIMs (including Win 10).

			# Updates are installed in order by filename, which always includes the KB# making older updates install before newer ones and Servicing Stack Updates start with "ssu" which makes them correctly install before other updates which start with "windows".
			# To find the required Servicing Stack Update for a specific Cumulative Update, check the "Prerequisite" section (in the "How to get this update" section) of the Support pages for the specific Cumulative Update, such as:
			# https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/may-29-2024-kb5037849-os-build-19045-4474-preview-cda7ed71-6202-45ed-a649-63b11fedabfe
			# (Use the Table of Contents navigation on the left of that page to navigate to the correct KB# for the Cumulative Update you are installing.)
			# When an error occurs, the DISM log will be opened in Notepad and there can also be useful information about what requirement is missing if you scroll to where the error occurred.
			# Once you have located the correct SSU, search it's KB# in the Microsoft Update Catalog (https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx), such as https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5031539
			# and find the correct name for the Windows version, such as "2023-10 Servicing Stack Update for Windows 10 Version 22H2 for x64-based Systems" and add that exact name to the list above to be installed conditionally for the correct Windows version.
			# NOTE: Any SSU added for a cumulative update should be removed if/when it is no longer needed, such as when an updated ISO has been released which pre-includes the newer updates.

			# For WinRE, some Cumulative Updates will fail with error 0x8007007e (ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND) even when the proper Servicing Stack Update is included, and I'm not certain why.
			# When this happens, the solution is to find the newest *previous* Cumulative Update or Cumulative Update Preview that works.
			# For example, CU KB5005565 (2021-09) + SSU KB5005260 (19041.1161) errors for WinRE, but using the previous CU KB5005101 (2021-08 Preview) + SSU KB5005260 (19041.1161) works fine.
			# So, in these cases, seperate older working updates for WinRE can be supplied in a "$wimOutputPath\WinRE Updates to Install" folder which can be manually created and filled and will not be overwritten by this automated update code.
			# See "PAST NOTES ABOUT MANUALLY DOWNLOADING UPDATES" below about how to manually search/download specific Cumulative Updates in the Microsoft Update Catalog.
			# NOTE: The "$wimOutputPath\WinRE Updates to Install" folder should be removed if/when those separate updates are no longer needed.

			# PAST NOTES ABOUT MANUALLY DOWNLOADING UPDATES:
			# IN THE PAST, to find the latest updates to be pre-installed, I just run a Windows installation and take note of any KB#'s that get installed by Windows Update during setup process and pre-install them into an updated WIM using this script instead of leaving Windows Update to do them (to save install/setup time).
			# To manually find the update files, I would perform searches of the Microsoft Update Catalog (https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx) for the update files like this: KB5011048 "Windows 10 Version 22H2 for x64" - Explanation: KB5011048 (the specific ID of the update you want) + "Windows 10 Version 22H2 for x64" in quotes to match only the exact windows version and architecture we want.
			# Link to the previous example search: https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5011048%20%22Windows%2010%20Version%2022H2%20for%20x64%22
			# ALSO, if you don't know the KB IDs, you can at least find the latest Cumulative Updates (for Windows and .NET including Cumulative Preview updates) by searching: "2023-10" Cumulative "Windows 10 Version 22H2 for x64" - Explanation: Same as above except filtering for only "Cumulative" Updates for the specified year and month *in quotes* like "YYYY-MM" to only match that exact update (obviously, set the year and month to the current or previous month for the latest updates).
			# Link to the previous example search: https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=%222023-10%22%20Cumulative%20%22Windows%2010%20Version%2022H2%20for%20x64%22
			# And for Windows 11: "2023-10" Cumulative "Windows 11 Version 22H2 for x64": https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=%222023-10%22%20Cumulative%20%22Windows%2011%20Version%2022H2%20for%20x64%22
			# After downloading desired update files, they would be put into the "$wimOutputPath\OS Updates to Install" folder to be installed by this script.
			# Also, (usually) only the latest updates need to be installed. For example, a previous Cumulative update file should be remove after a new Cumulative update is added so that both are not unnecessarily installed.

			# IMPORTANT NOTE *FROM THE PAST* ABOUT UPDATING WINRE IN WINDOWS 10 21H2 (IN REGARDS TO TPM VERSION DETECTION):
			# Something changed or broke in a Cumulative Update for WinRE in Win 10 21H2 that makes WinRE not be able to detect the TPM version to determine Windows 11 support. (But, all updates I've tried seem to function properly in WinRE in Win 10 21H2 other than TPM detection.)
			# TPM detection WORKS PROPERLY in the un-updated WinRE in Win 10 21H2 and ALSO WORKS PROPERLY with the KB5007186 (2021-11) Cumulative Update applied to WinRE in Win 10 21H2.
			# BUT, TPM detection FAILS when any newer Cumulative Update is installed so far (as of March 2022), including KB5007253 (2021-11 Preview), KB5008212 (2021-12), and KB5009543 (2022-01), KB5010793 (Also 2022-01), KB5010342 (2022-02), KB5010415 (2022-02 Preview), and KB5011487 (2022-03)
			# So, can use the "WinRE Updates to Install" folder to keep installing KB5007186 (2021-11) along with the latest .NET update for WinRE, while still installing the latest Cumulative and .NET updates into the full OS using the separate "OS Updates to Install" folder.
			# I submitted a report to Microsoft about this issue through Feedback Hub on 01/14/22 and have not got any response as of 03/28/22.

			# CONCLUSION: I started using WinRE from Win 11 21H2 as our installation environment and not worry about this TPM detection issue in WinRE from Win 10 anymore since a fully updated WinRE from Win 11 21H2 gets the job done.

					# IMPORTANT: When creating WinRE 10 22H2 images (from Windows 10 22H2), I ran into an issue I had never run into before where critical system files could end up being removed from the final exported WinRE/Windows images.
					# I am not sure exactly how or why this happened, and it only happened rarely, but I was able to reproduce the issue after many reattempts of creating the updated Windows 10 images.
					# In all my testing, this issue never seemed to happen to Windows 11 images, but since it is so inconsistent/rare I'm not sure that it couldn't happen on Windows 11 images as well, so they will also be verified.
					# Also, I was previously using the older built-in version of DISM located at "/Windows/System32/Dism.exe" rather than the latest version of DISM from the ADK (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install#choose-the-right-adk-for-your-scenario), which is now being used by running "DandISetEnv.bat" before this script is launched.
					# Since switching to the using the latest DISM in the latest Window 11 22H2 ADK I have not seen this issue, but since it was so inconsistent I'm unsure whether or not using the latest DISM actually avoids the issue.
					# I'm also unsure whether using the latest DISM from the ADK affects the PowerShell cmdlets such as "Export-WindowsImage", but I'm also unsure whether the issue happened at that step or before that at the "DISM /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase" step.
					# It's possible the files were being removed because they became corrupted, which may actually indicate some issue with my SSD and not with any of the software being used, but that is just speculation since my SSD appears to be perfectly healthy when checked with "Hard Disk Sentinel".
					# Since I'm unsure exactly where or why the issue was actually happening, I decided to just manually verify the exported images contents to make sure they contain all the expected system files that are present in the original image.
					# I also noticed that when this happened usually many files were removed resulting in the exported image being smaller than the source image, so the file sizes are compared first as an initial fast way to detect the issue without having to do the longer file comparison.
					# If the exported image is larger than the source image, the system file lists are still compared, excluding all the paths that are expected to be different.
					# Excluding the paths that are expected to be different makes the file path comparison much faster, and still ensures that all the critical System32 contents (etc) are present in the exported image.
					# Since it could be possible that some files are removed from the paths that are expected to be different (which aren't being checked), this verification should not be considered to be 100% thorough,
					# but in my testing when the issue happens many files get removed and this verification was able to detect the issue to stop the process and alert that the exported image should not be used.
					# If this verification fails, there is no way to correct the problem from this point and the script should just be run again to re-create the updated images from scrach, which should usually work fine the next time.
